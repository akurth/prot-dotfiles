Custom desktop session centred around BSPWM and Emacs
=====================================================

**UPDATE 2019-10-23:** I produced a video where, among others, I talk
about my outlook concerning my BSPWM session (and this repo).  Some
_major breaking changes_ are in the works.  Please watch and remember
that you can always use my free/libre book, which is also mention in the
"Get my configs" section below.  That book contains a stable "snapshot"
of my configurations with code that was developed before my switch to
Emacs (early July 2019).

Get my configs
--------------

To reproduce my custom desktop session on Debian 10 'buster', follow the
detailed instructions in my book "Prot's Dots for Debian (PDFD)":
https://protesilaos.com/pdfd.  It is freely available under the terms of
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License Version 4.0
International.

PDFD will only offer guidance about the latest "fixed release" of my
dotfiles.  These are tagged with the appropriate annotation (formatted
as <version>-pdfd<?\_label>) and are then synced with a separate code
repo, titled "Code for PDFD": https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/cpdfd

**As such, PDFD does not contain the latest breaking changes.** Please
contact me, if you have any questions: https://protesilaos.com/contact/

Do not track my dotfiles directly
---------------------------------

My dotfiles' repo functions as a laboratory for my custom desktop
session.  I offer no support whatsoever about tracking it and may
introduce breaking changes without prior notice.

Just use PDFD.  It is why I spent an inordinate amount of time cleaning
up the code, documenting it extensively, and ultimately writing
instructions about how to reproduce it.

That granted, you can always open an issue here or contribute any fixes.
