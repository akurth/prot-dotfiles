Custom desktop session centred around BSPWM and Emacs
=====================================================

**UPDATE 2019-10-23:** I produced a video where, among others, I talked
about my outlook concerning my BSPWM session (and this repo).  Some
_major breaking changes_ are in the works.  Please watch and remember
that you can always use my free/libre book, which is also mentioned in
the "Get my configs" section below.  That book contains a stable
"snapshot" of my configurations with code that was developed before my
switch to Emacs (early July 2019).

Get my configs
--------------

To reproduce _the previous iteration_ of my custom desktop session on
Debian 10 'buster', follow the detailed instructions in my book "Prot's
Dots for Debian" (PDFD): https://protesilaos.com/pdfd.  It is freely
available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
License, Version 4.0 International.

The major difference between the present unstable state and the one in
PDFD is that now I am making changes to accommodate Emacs.  Before that
I was using Tmux+Vim together with other standalone CLI programs.

PDFD will only offer guidance about the latest stable state of my
dotfiles.  The code has been forked from this repository and is
maintained as a separate project _for as long as Debian 10 'buster' is
the current stable version_: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/cpdfd

**As such, PDFD will never contain the latest breaking changes.** Please
contact me if you have any questions: https://protesilaos.com/contact/

Do not track my dotfiles directly
---------------------------------

My dotfiles' repo functions as a laboratory for my custom desktop
session.  I offer no support whatsoever about tracking it and may
introduce breaking changes without prior notice.

Just use PDFD.  It is why I spent an inordinate amount of time cleaning
up the code, documenting it extensively, and ultimately writing
instructions on how to reproduce it.

That granted, you can always open an issue here or contribute any fixes.
