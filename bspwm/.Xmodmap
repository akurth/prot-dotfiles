!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

! These settings have been implemented succesfully on Debian 10
! 'buster' running a variety of desktop environments on top of Xorg.

! To get the current status of the modifiers:
!
!    xmodmap -pm
!
! To find out the key codes that are available:
!
!    xmodmap -pke
!
! Or narrow the results, e.g.:
!
!    xmodmap -pke | grep -E '(Alt|Shift)'
!
! Alternatively, use `xev` to print the key code upon key press.
!
! Here are some of the most likely candidates for changes:
!
!    keycode 37  = Control_L
!    keycode 50  = Shift_L
!    keycode 62  = Shift_R
!    keycode 64  = Alt_L
!    keycode 66  = Caps_Lock
!    keycode 77  = Num_Lock
!    keycode 105 = Control_R
!    keycode 108 = Alt_R
!    keycode 133 = Super_L
!    keycode 134 = Super_R
!    keycode 135 = Menu

! Modifications !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

! Sometimes the Hyper key is bundled with Mod4 (Super).  So what we want
! is to remove it from that group.  Mod4 should just cover Super.  Then
! I choose to bind Hyper to the Caps key and the right Win key
! (Super_R).

! I know that many Emacs users use Caps as an extra Ctrl, but I have
! never gotten used to that.  Whereas now I can use Hyper for my tiling
! window manager, and leave Ctrl, Meta, Super for Emacs.  Furthermore, I
! am aware that Emacs can bind different keys to Meta and Alt, but I
! still have no use for that and do not want to increase the complexity
! of my key bindings.

! Clear affected keys
clear lock
clear mod3
clear mod4

! Set the Menu key as Compose
keycode 135 = Multi_key

! Caps Lock as left Hyper
keycode 66 = Hyper_L

! Right Super as Right Hyper
keycode 134 = Hyper_R

! Set mod3 to capslock/hyper
add mod3 = Hyper_L Hyper_R

! Keep Super in tact
add mod4 = Super_L Super_R
