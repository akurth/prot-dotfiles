About my font configurations
============================

Prior notes:

* When running `stow fonts` inside my dotfiles' root directory, you will
  be symlinking outline fonts at ~/.local/share/fonts/FONT
* Similarly, Bitmap fonts will be placed at ~/.local/share/fonts/bitmap
* Following a successful `stow fonts`, a copy of this file is available
  at ~/.config/fontconfig/README and ~/.local/share/fonts/README

1 About fonts.conf (only for outline fonts)
-------------------------------------------

For each style these are the default fonts, in order:

* Serif: DejaVu Serif, Noto Serif, Liberation Serif.
* Sans: FiraGO, Roboto, DejaVu Sans, Noto Sans, Liberation Sans.
* Monospace: Hack, DejaVu Sans Mono, Fira Code, Mononoki.
* Emoji: Noto Color Emoji.

FiraGO and Hack are distributed with my dotfiles (more below).  The
Debian archives contain all the other fonts.  The package names:

* fonts-dejavu
* fonts-firacode
* fonts-liberation
* fonts-liberation2
* fonts-mononoki
* fonts-noto
* fonts-noto-color-emoji
* fonts-roboto

2 About my ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/
---------------------------------------

This directory includes rules that are meant to override the defaults
offered by Debian.  See /etc/fonts/conf.d/ to find out what the defaults
are on a Debian system.  Last tested on 2019-03-21.

3 My fonts: FiraGO and Hack
---------------------------

FiraGO is the continuation of Fira Sans.  It has international language
support.

* Get it from source[1].  Only Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic are
  bundled with my dotfiles.
* Distributed under the terms of the SIL Open Font License Version 1.1.

Hack is available in the Debian repos, but I use a patched variant that
I prepared myself[2].

* See ~/.local/share/fonts/Hack-alt/README.md for what the patches
  pertain to.
* Distributed under the terms of the MIT License to be consistent with
  the terms of the alternative glyphs provided by the upstream
  developers of Hack.

If you do not like FiraGO and/or Hack, comment them out in the
`60-latin.conf` file inside my `conf.d/`.

Note that the fonts installed locally take precedence over the ones
on the system.  As such, my Hack alternative will be used over the
`fonts-hack` package.  I personally do not install the Debian package, 
just to make sure.

4 About the Bitmap fonts I distribute
-------------------------------------

The Bitmap fonts bundled with my dotfiles are:

* Gohu Font (WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License)[3]
* Tamzen Font (Free license)[4]
* Siji Font (GPL2)[5]

They are all used in my custom `lemonbar` script to draw the system 
panel.  For that, see `melonpanel` inside my dotfiles' "bin" directory.

For how to use Bitmap fonts, consider this resource on the X server's 
demands[6].
