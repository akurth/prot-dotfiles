Prior notes:
    - When running `stow fonts` inside my dotfiles' root directory, you 
      will be symlinking outline fonts at ~/.local/share/fonts/<FONT>
    - When running `stow fonts` inside my dotfiles' root directory, you 
      will be symlinking Bitmap fonts at ~/.local/share/fonts/bitmap
    - Following a successful `stow fonts`, a copy of this file is 
      available at ~/.config/fontconfig/README and 
      ~/.local/share/fonts/README

1 About fonts.conf (only for outline fonts)
-------------------------------------------
Default fonts are FiraGO, DejaVu Serif, Hack (alt), Noto Color Emoji.

FiraGO is the continuation of Fira Sans.  It has international language 
support.

- Get it from source[1].  Only Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic are 
  bundled with my dotfiles.
- Distributed under the terms of the SIL Open Font License Version 1.1.

Hack is available in the Debian repos, but I use a patched variant
that I prepared myself[2].

- See fonts/.local/share/fonts/Hack-alt/README.md for what the patches 
  pertain to.
- Distributed under the terms of the MIT License to be consistent with 
  the terms of the alternative glyphs provided by the upstream 
  developers of Hack.

The DejaVu Serif typeface should be part of a new Debian install.
Otherwise, you can get it with:

	apt install fonts-dejavu

The emoji fonts needs be installed with:

	apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji

If you do not like FiraGO and/or Hack, comment them out in the
fonts.conf. Then enable the currently commented out alternatives that
belong to the DejaVu family.

Note that the fonts installed locally take precedence over the ones
on the system.  As such, my Hack alternative will be used over the
`fonts-hack` package.  I personally do not install the Debian package, 
just to make sure.

2. About conf.d/
----------------

This directory includes rules that are meant to override the defaults
offered by Debian.

The changes I have introduced concern the approval or enablement of the
Bitmap fonts that are distributed with my dotfiles.  There also are
rules to unhint the Hack typeface at small sizes (makes it excellent at
8pt).

See /etc/fonts/conf.d/ to find out what the defaults are on an 
up-to-date Debian system.  Last tested on 2018-12-18.

3. About the Bitmap fonts I distribute
--------------------------------------

The Bitmap fonts bundled with my dotfiles are:

    - Gohu Font (WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License)[3]
    - Tamzen Font (Free license)[4]
    - Siji Font (GPL2)[5]

They are all used in my custom `lemonbar` script to draw the system 
panel.  For that, see "melonpanel" inside my dotfiles' "bin" directory.

For how to use Bitmap fonts, consider this resource on the X server's 
demands[6].
