My fork of ST - Simple Terminal
===============================

This is a fork of `st` version 0.8.1 (released on 2018-03-20) by
suckless.org that introduces the following minor changes:

* Applies patches included in the "patches" directory.
* Changes the path prefix to $HOME.  See `config.mk`.  This works
  because I assume a "bin" folder in the user home directory, which is
  added to the $PATH.

Furthermore, there are deviations from upstream pertaining to the
integration of this program with my custom working environment, which is
built around the Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager.  My `st` is
typically used in tandem with `tmux`.  The contents of this repository,
minus the `.git` directory are part of my dotfiles so they can be
managed with GNU Stow.  For the complete implementation, see
https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles.

To this end, this fork implements stylistic changes:

1. A generic font specification that leverages `fontconfig` aliases.
   The fonts are defined in `fonts.conf`.  See my dotfiles for more,
   specifically the content of the "fonts" directory.
2. Consolidation and outsourcing of all colour-related options.  The
   theme that is used via an `include` directive in `config.deh.f` is
   part of my Tempus Themes project.
   
For the former point, note that I bundle some font files with my
dotfiles.  These are either patched variants of existing fonts, or items
that are not available in my GNU/Linux distro.

As for the latter point, bear in mind that the theme files are included
in the "themes" directory.  A standalone repository is also available at
https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/tempus-themes-st.  You may find more
information about the Tempus Themes project and its available ports on
my website, at https//protesilaos.com/tempus-themes.  These are an
integral part of my custom working environment.

Build dependencies on Debian Buster/Sid
---------------------------------------

To install on Debian Buster/Sid, you need these first:

    sudo apt install libx11-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev

To prevent ST from segfaulting when trying to display emoji or similar
symbols, also do:

	sudo apt install fonts-symbola
