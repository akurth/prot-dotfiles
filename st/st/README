Soft fork of ST - Simple Terminal
=================================

Intended for use with my custom desktop session on Debian Buster (refer
to my dotfiles).

* My dots: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

Description
-----------

This is a fork of `st` version 0.8.2 (released on 2019-02-09) by the
Suckless community.  It is meant to be used in tandem with my custom
desktop session, which is based on BSPWM.

My changes are defined in "st-protesilaos-stavrou-soft-fork-0.8.2.diff`.
They concern the following:

* Compile the program inside the user's home directory.  This is done by
  altering the path prefix in `config.mk`.  The working assumption is
  that the user has a "bin" directory in their $HOME and it is added to
  the $PATH.
* A generic font specification that leverages `fontconfig` aliases.  The
  fonts are defined in `fonts.conf`.  See my dotfiles for more,
  specifically the content of the "fonts" directory.
* Consolidation and outsourcing of all colour-related options.  The
  theme that is used via an `include` directive in `config.deh.f` is
  part of my Tempus Themes project.  Relevant theme files are also
  distributed with my dotfiles.  For more about the project, see
  https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/tempus-themes

Preparing the patch
-------------------

Using the `0.8.2` release tarball, I extracted the files into
`~/st-0.8.2-upstream`.  Then I copied that directory into
`~/st-0.8.2-prot-soft-fork`, where I introduced my changes.  The `.diff`
was created with:

	diff -up ~/st-0.8.2-upstream ~/st-0.8.2-prot-soft-fork/ > \
	st-protesilaos-stavrou-soft-fork-0.8.2.diff	
   
Build dependencies on Debian Buster/Sid
---------------------------------------

To install on Debian Buster, you need these first:

    sudo apt install libx11-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev pkgconf libfreetype6-dev

To prevent ST from segfaulting when trying to display emoji or similar
symbols, also do:

	sudo apt install fonts-symbola
