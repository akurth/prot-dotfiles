;;; Commentary:
;;
;; One of the upsides of Denote's file-naming scheme is the predictable
;; pattern it establishes, which appears as a near-tabular presentation in
;; a listing of notes (i.e. in Dired).  The `denote-dired-mode' can help
;; enhance this impression, by fontifying the components of the file name
;; to make the date (identifier) and keywords stand out.
;;
;; There are two ways to set the mode.  Either use it for all directories,
;; which probably is not needed:
;;
;;     (require 'denote-dired)
;;     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode)
;;
;; Or configure the user option `denote-dired-directories' and then set up
;; the function `denote-dired-mode-in-directories':
;;
;;     (require 'denote-dired)
;;
;;     ;; We use different ways to specify a path for demo purposes.
;;     (setq denote-dired-directories
;;           (list denote-directory
;;                 (thread-last denote-directory (expand-file-name "attachments"))
;;                 (expand-file-name "~/Documents/vlog")))
;;
;;     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode-in-directories)
;;
;; The `denote-dired-mode' does not only fontify note files that were
;; created by Denote: it covers every file name that follows our naming
;; conventions (read about "The file-naming scheme" in the manual).
;; This is particularly useful for scenaria where, say, one wants to
;; organise their collection of PDFs and multimedia in a systematic way
;; (and, perhaps, use them as attachments for the notes Denote
;; produces).
;;
;; For the time being, the `diredfl' package is not compatible with this
;; facility.
