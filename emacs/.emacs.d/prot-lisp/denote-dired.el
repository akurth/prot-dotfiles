;;; Commentary:
;;
;; One of the upsides of Denote's file-naming scheme is the predictable
;; pattern it establishes, which appears as a near-tabular presentation in
;; a listing of notes (i.e. in Dired).  The `denote-dired-mode' can help
;; enhance this impression, by fontifying the components of the file name
;; to make the date (identifier) and keywords stand out.
;;
;; There are two ways to set the mode.  Either use it for all directories,
;; which probably is not needed:
;;
;;     (require 'denote-dired)
;;     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode)
;;
;; Or configure the user option `denote-dired-directories' and then set up
;; the function `denote-dired-mode-in-directories':
;;
;;     (require 'denote-dired)
;;
;;     ;; We use different ways to specify a path for demo purposes.
;;     (setq denote-dired-directories
;;           (list denote-directory
;;                 (thread-last denote-directory (expand-file-name "attachments"))
;;                 (expand-file-name "~/Documents/vlog")))
;;
;;     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'denote-dired-mode-in-directories)
;;
;; The `denote-dired-mode' does not only fontify note files that were
;; created by Denote: it covers every file name that follows our naming
;; conventions (read about "The file-naming scheme" in the manual).
;; This is particularly useful for scenaria where, say, one wants to
;; organise their collection of PDFs and multimedia in a systematic way
;; (and, perhaps, use them as attachments for the notes Denote
;; produces).
;;
;; For the time being, the `diredfl' package is not compatible with this
;; facility.

If in Dired consider FILE the one at point, else prompt with
completion.

If FILE has a Denote-style identifier, retain it while updating
the TITLE and KEYWORDS fields.  Else create an identifier,
replacing the whole name.

The file type extension (e.g. .pdf) is read from the underlying
file and is preserved in the renaming process.  Files that have
no extension are simply left without one.

Renaming only occurs relative to the current directory.  Files
are not moved between directories.

This command is intended to (i) rename existing Denote
notes, (ii) complement note-taking, such as by renaming
attachments that the user adds to their notes."
