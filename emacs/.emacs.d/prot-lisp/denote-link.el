;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The linking facility is subject to review and there will likely be
;; breaking changes.  This is the only area that needs to be fixed
;; before we release the first stable version of the package.

;;; Code:

(require 'denote-retrieve)

(defgroup denote-link ()
  "Link facility for Denote."
  :group 'denote)

;;;; User options

(defcustom denote-link-fontify-backlinks t
  "When non-nil, apply faces to files in the backlinks' buffer."
  :type 'boolean
  :group 'denote-link)

(defcustom denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action
  '((display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-below-selected)
    (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer))
  "The action used to display the current file's backlinks buffer.

The value has the form (FUNCTION . ALIST), where FUNCTION is
either an \"action function\", a list thereof, or possibly an
empty list.  ALIST is a list of \"action alist\" which may be
omitted (or be empty).

Sample configuration to display the buffer in a side window on
the left of the Emacs frame:

    (setq denote-link-backlinks-display-buffer-action
          (quote ((display-buffer-reuse-window
                   display-buffer-in-side-window)
                  (side . left)
                  (slot . 99)
                  (window-width . 0.3))))

See Info node `(elisp) Displaying Buffers' for more details
and/or the documentation string of `display-buffer'."
  :type '(cons (choice (function :tag "Display Function")
                       (repeat :tag "Display Functions" function))
               alist)
  :group 'denote-link)

;;;; Link to note

;; FIXME 2022-06-14 16:58:24 +0300: Plain text links will use the
;; identifier only.  But for Org we need to figure out a better way of
;; integrating with Org/Markdown in a standard way.  Relying on
;; org-id.el may be the right course of action for Org.  What does
;; markdown-mode require?
;;
;; Whatever we do, we need to consider the implications very carefully.
;; This is not something we can undo once the package gets its first
;; stable release.
;;
;; My principle is to avoid dependencies as much as possible.  The
;; `denote-link-find-file' exemplifies this idea.
