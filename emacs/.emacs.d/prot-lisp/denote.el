;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Denote is a simple, yet effective note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is
;; based on the principle that notes must follow a predictable and
;; descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name alone should offer a
;; clear indication of what the note is about, without reference to any
;; other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such
;; files.
;;
;; What Denote prioritizes with the enforcement of a strict file-naming
;; scheme is portability.  Notes can be accessed, filtered, and understood
;; without Emacs or any other advanced tool for that matter (though Emacs,
;; Org, and the like are excellent programs).
;;
;; Denote only has a strong opinion about the file name.  It otherwise is
;; flexible and poses no constraints on the desired workflow.  Denote has
;; no mechanism to test for adherence to a given note-taking method, such
;; as that of Zettelkasten (i.e. the contemporary digital equivalent of
;; Niklas Luhmann's methodology).  It is possible to employ such a method,
;; though it is ultimately up to the user to apply the requisite rigor.
;; What matters for our purposes is that Denote is not a zettelkasten
;; implementation per se.
;;
;; By default, Denote creates note files using the `.org' extension.
;; However, Denote does not depend on org.el or any of its accoutrements
;; and extensions.  Users are given the option to change from Org to either
;; Markdown (`.md') or Plain Text (`.txt'), as explained further in the
;; manual (search for `denote-file-type').
;;
;; "Denote" is the familiar word, though it also is a play on to the "note"
;; concept.  Plus, we can come up with acronyms (of dubious utility) like:
;;
;; + Don't Ever Note Only The Ephemeral
;; + Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses
;;
;; But we'll let you get back to work.  Don't Eschew or Neglect your
;; Obligations, Tasks, Engagements...

If a string, use it as the argument of `format-time-string'.
Read the documentation of that function for valid format
specifiers.
