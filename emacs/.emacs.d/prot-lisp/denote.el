;;; Commentary:
;;
;; "Denote" is the familiar word, though it also is a play on to the
;; "note" concept.  Plus, we can come up with acronyms like:
;;
;; * Don't Ever Note Only The Ephemeral
;; * Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses
;;
;; But I'll let you get back to work.  Don't Escape or Neglect your
