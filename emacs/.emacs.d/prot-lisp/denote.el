;;; Commentary:
;;
;; NOTE THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TOWARDS VERSION `0.1.0' AND MIGHT
;; STILL INTRODUCE BREAKING, BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES.  This is
;; particularly true for the linking facility.  Everything else is in a
;; stable state.
;;
;; Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
;; note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the following core design
;; principles:
;;
;; * Predictability :: File names must follow a consistent and
;;   descriptive naming convention (read the manual's "The file-naming
;;   scheme").  The file name alone should offer a clear indication of
;;   what the contents are, without reference to any other metadatum.
;;   This convention is not specific to note-taking, as it is pertinent
;;   to any form of file that is part of the user's long-term storage
;;   (read the manual's "Renaming files").
;;
;; * Composability :: Be a good Emacs citizen, by integrating with other
;;   packages or built-in functionality instead of re-inventing
;;   functions such as for filtering or greping.  Do not introduce
;;   dependencies on specific libraries.  While Org is a killer app for
;;   Emacs and the default file type for new notes, Denote does not
;;   depend on org.el nor its extensions and does allow notes to be
;;   created in a variety of formats ((read the manual's "Notes in
;;   multiple file types").  The author of Denote (Protesilaos, aka
;;   "Prot") writes ordinary notes in plain text (`.txt'), switching to
;;   an Org file only when its expanded set of functionality is required
;;   for the task at hand (read the manual's "Points of entry").
;;
;; * Portability :: Notes are plain text and should remain portable.
;;   The way Denote writes file names, the front matter it include in
;;   the note's header, and the links it establishes must all be
;;   adequately usable with standard Unix tools.  No need for a databse
;;   or some specialised software.  As Denote develops and this manual
;;   is fully fleshed out, there will be concrete examples on how to do
;;   the Denote-equivalent on the command-line.
;;
;; * Flexibility :: Do not assume the user's preference for a
;;   note-taking methodology.  Denote is conceptually similar to the
;;   Zettelkasten Method, which you can learn more about in this
;;   detailed introduction: <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>.
;;   Notes are atomic (one file per note) and have a unique identifier.
;;   However, Denote does not enforce a particular methodology for
;;   knowledge management, such as a restricted vocabulary or mutually
;;   exclusive sets of keywords.  It is up to the user to apply the
;;   requisite rigor in pursuit of their preferred workflow.
;;
;; Now the important part...  "Denote" is the familiar word, though it
;; also is a play on the "note" concept.  Plus, we can come up with
;; acronyms, recursive or otherwise, of increasingly dubious utility
;; like:
;;
;; * Don't Ever Note Only The Epiphenomenal
;; * Denote Everything Neatly; Omit The Excesses
;;
;; But we'll let you get back to work.  Don't Eschew or Neglect your
;; Obligations, Tasks, and Engagements.
