;;; Commentary:

;; This file sets up the essentials for incorporating my init org
;; file.  This is known as "literate programming", which I think is
;; particularly helpful for sharing Emacs configurations with a wider
;; audience that includes new or potential users (I am still very new
;; myself).
;;
;; See my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

;;; Code:

(setq straight-use-package-by-default nil)

(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
      (bootstrap-version 5))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer

         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))

  ;; The following is VERY IMPORTANT.  Write hooks using their real name
  ;; instead of a shorter version: after-init ==> `after-init-hook'.

  (setq use-package-hook-name-suffix nil))

;; I create an "el" version of my Org configuration file as a final step
;; before closing down Emacs.  This is done to load the latest version
;; of my code upon startup.
;;
;; Also helps with initialisation times.  Not that I care too much about
;; thoseâ€¦ Hence why I no longer bother with deferring package loading
;; either by default or on a case-by-case basis.
