# Description {{{
# ---------------
#
# This script has a dual purpose when executed from my laptop:
#
# 1. To be run at the start of a `bspwm` session in order to determine
#    whether to apply my dual monitor setup.
# 2. To configure the display manager so that its output is as intended.
#
# The `lightdm` display manager (the login screen) can have trouble
# setting the correct layout for a multihead setup where the monitors
# have different display resolutions.  On my ThinkPad X220 I often
# connect a 1920x1080 monitor via the VGA port.  What this SIMPLISTIC
# script does is make sure that `lightdm` runs the appropriate `xrandr`
# command, depending on whether the external monitor is connected or
# not.
#
# This script is part of my custom desktop session.  For more, see my
# dotfiles https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles.

# Configure this for LightDM {{{
#
# To instruct `lightdm` to run this at startup on a machine running
# Debian Buster/Sid, you must edit `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` (requires
# root privileges, but make sure you back up the original):
#
# 1. Under the `[Seat:*]` section, search for "display-setup-script".
# 2. Comment it out to enable it and add the path to this script.
#
# Example:
#
# display-setup-script=/home/prot/bin/own_script_laptop_dual_monitor
#
# Note that when searching for "display-setup-script" the first result
# is the description.  Make sure you find the one below the `[Seat:*]`
# which has no comment mark in front of it.
#
# Dependencies:
#
# sudo apt install lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter
#
# This might also work with other greeters, such as `slick-greeter`.
# Needs further testing.

my_laptop_external_monitor=$(xrandr --query | grep 'VGA1 connected')

# If the VGA1 port connects to a monitor, the output of the variable
# will not be empty.  In which case it is assumed that I am using my
# secondary display, whose resolution I know in advance.  If the
# variable is empty, then no external monitor is connected.
#
# This is a simplistic approach which will not work if the external
# monitor has another resolution.  It will also fail if executed from
# another machine, say, another laptop that uses an HDMI connection
# instead.
