# README for dependencies {{{
# ---------------------------

# Builds theme files for all items in the Tempus Themes collection and
# places them in their corresponding location inside my dotfiles.  For
# this to work, there are two prerequisites.
#
# 1. My dotfiles are in the home directory.  See
#    https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
# 2. The Tempus Themes generator is also at the home dir.  See:
#    https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/tempus-themes-generator
# 
# The utility of this script is only realised when I modify the source
# of the existing Tempus Themes and/or add a new theme (new templates
# would require modifications to this script).  It makes it easy to
# incorporate those changes to my dots.
#
# Note that this script only builds files that are included with my
# dotfiles.  The Tempus Themes generator has templates for programs that
# I do not actively use, such as Tilix and Konsole. If you wish to
# contribute to the Tempus Themes project, see the generator's
# CONTRIBUTING.md.

# NOTE this script is not fool proof, so if you have something else that
# meets those conditions, you might run into unexpected behaviour.

# Core functions for all the build processes {{{
# ----------------------------------------------

# This is the generator's command.  The script accepts two arguments.
# The first is the name of the scheme.  The second is the template.  For
# example, the following will output the Winter colours for Vim to
# stdout:
#
# ./tempus-themes-generator.sh winter vim
#
# This can then be redirected into a file.
#
# As such, the `invoke_generator()` accepts a total of four arguments
# from the subsequent functions.  In order, these pass the following
# information:
#
# 1. Scheme name
# 2. Template name
# 3. Destination path
# 4. Name of output file
invoke_generator() {
    "$tempus_generator_script" "$1" "$2" > "$3"/tempus_"$4"
}

# As there are a number of Tempus schemes, we will run a loop that
# iterates over each of them.  This executes the `invoke_generator()`,
# passing to it the scheme name which is needed for that function's
# arguments 1 and 4 (see its description).
#
# The `invoke_generic_loop()` accepts threee arguments from subsequent
# functions.  These define the following:
#
# 1. Template name
# 2. Destination path
# 3. File type extension
invoke_generic_loop() {
    for i in $tempus_schemes

#
# 1. The 'gtksourceview{3,4}' template name
# 2. Destination path for $HOME/.local/share/gtksourceview-{3.0,4}/styles
