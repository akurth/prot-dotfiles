## Commentary:
#
# Simple tool to switch between Adwaita and Adwaita-dark and to perform
# the equivalent action for Emacs.  This has been tested with GNOME
# version 3.36, though it is expected to work in several of the recent
# previous releases.
#
# Part of my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles


# Generic `gsettings' call
_ggtk () {
    gsettings "$1" org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "${@:2}"
}

# Get the theme
_gget () {
    _ggtk 'get'
}

# Set the theme
_gset () {
    _ggtk 'set' "$1"
}

# Check for dependency, else exit the given function that calls this.
_depcheck() {
	command -v "$1" > /dev/null || { echo "Missing dependency: $1."; return 1; }
}

_emacs() {
    _depcheck emacs

    # Only proceed if Emacs is running
    pgrep -x emacs > /dev/null || return 1

    # Just switch to the appropriate theme for Emacs:
    # https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes
    #
    # This relies on functions of mine that are part of my Emacs
    # configurations.  As such, this design can be considered fragile.
