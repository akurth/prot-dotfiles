## Commentary:
#
# Simple tool to switch between Adwaita and Adwaita-dark and to perform
# the equivalent action for Emacs using my Modus themes.
#
# This has been tested with GNOME version 3.36 and Xfce 4.16, though it
# is expected to work with several of the recent previous releases of
# those Desktop Environments.
#
# Part of my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
