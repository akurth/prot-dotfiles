# Very simple, but effective, script to switch keyboard layouts between
# US QWERTY and standard Greek.  This script is assigned to a key chord
# in my `sxkdrc`.  A variant of this is also included in my system
# panel, the `melonpanel` to get the current layout.

# Everything is part of my dotfiles.  See
# https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles.
