# sets the border colours for bspwm by sourcing a file with colour
# values
# EXPLAIN: bspwm does not read the custom colours if they are sourced
# from another file at launch.  Instead it defaults to its own colour
# values.  Here I set the defaults I would prefer to have, while I
# autostart the script that sources and then applies the colours I
# actually want.
